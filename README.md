# ANH Bank

We've always made apps like this at college or at courses. This time I wanted to make a better one on my own, for self-improvement.


## What have I done here:

- On start, shows servers available on PC so user can choose which one to connect.
- Creates database (EF Code First) and writes default values to a file, which checks if it exists and if not creates all the folders, and then adds them to DB.


## Resources

- https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/docs
- https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Samples.htm
- And hundreds of Microsoft Docs :)
